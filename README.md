# Dog Breed Classification using CNN

This deep learning project utilizes a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model for classifying dog breeds. The following files are included:

- `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the project.
- `predict.py`: Use this script to make predictions on new dog images using the trained model.
- `train.py`: This script is responsible for training the CNN model on the preprocessed data.
- `xml_to_csv.py`: A utility script to convert XML annotation files to CSV format for data preprocessing.

Please note that the dataset is not provided in this repository. You need to obtain a suitable dog breed dataset and organize it before running the scripts. Get started with the dog breed classification project and enjoy classifying adorable doggies! üêæ #DogBreedClassification #CNN #DeepLearning #MachineLearning
